### Hi there 👋 I'm Ckalib Nelson

I'm a Business Intelligence Engineer at Amazon with a deep love for data—how it moves, what it reveals, and the stories it can tell. I leverage data to improve decision-making, design better customer experiences, and create opportunities both professionally and in the community.
